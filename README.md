# Reflow oven controller
An open source controller for converting kitchen toaster oven to reflow oven.<br />

The project consist of PCB and firmware to convert clasic toaste oven to temperature controled oven for PCB reflow.<br />
Oven options:<br />
- Reflow - follows the predefined temperature curve to optimal reflow PCBs
- Dry - keeps defined temperature for set amount of time (dry components, filaments...)
<br />
Oven used in these build is cheap (40â‚¬) 9l toaster oven with two heating elements (quartz heating tube) - BROCK TO9001B.<br />
One of concerns was that it will not be able to heat up quich enough but becouse the heating chaimber is small it can heats up quick enough<br />
SSR is used for controlling heating elements and 12V 4A PSU to power the entire electronics.
